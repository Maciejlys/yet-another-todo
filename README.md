# Yet another todo

Welcome to the **Yet-another-todo** project! This is a simple API built to manage tasks, created using **Node.js** and **Golang** to experiment and learn backend development concepts, particularly for a frontend developer diving into full-stack development.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to practice and learn:

- Backend development concepts.
- Database integration and querying.
- Learning to manage data from a backend perspective.

## Tech Stack

- **Node.js** (with Express.js and Typescript)
- **Golang** (with net/http, chi and sqlx)
- **Database**: SQLite3 (in case of node.js it was better-sqlite3)
- **Postman** for API testing

## Features

- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for Todos.
- Simple RESTful API design.
- Database integration for persistent task storage.
- Separate implementations using Node.js and Golang for comparison and learning.
